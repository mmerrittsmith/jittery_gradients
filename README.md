# jittery_gradients

A generative art project for #Genuary 2020. 

Initializes using a number of lines, a height, a width, and a starting RGB value. 

Results in a discrete gradient where the shape of the bands becomes more irregular as the height increases, and the color changes bit by bit as well in a random way.

I like this type of visual, and I think it's an interesting depiction of entropic behaviour.
